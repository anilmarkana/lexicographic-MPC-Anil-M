1. Dynopt is an opensource optimization toolbox and can be integrated with matlab using the inclusion of dynopt folders.
2. Dynopt is a set of MATLAB functions for determination of optimal control trajectory given the description of the process, the cost to be minimised, subject to equality and inequality constraints.
3. Both documentation and code sources are available at https://bitbucket.org/dynopt.
4. Run lexicographic_shmpc_main_file.m for lexicographic optimization based model predective control using EKF.
5. Run lexicographic_shmpc_withoutEKF.m for lexicographic optimization based model predective control without EKF.
