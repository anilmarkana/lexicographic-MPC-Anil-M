	* examples tested with matlab 2013b. 

2012-11-27  Martin Jelemensky  <martin.jelemensky@stuba.sk> Version 4.1.4

	* liniconstr.m: bug if only one time interval was optimised

2012-06-21  Miroslav Fikar  <miroslav.fikar@stuba.sk>

	* added examples car, car2: minimum time problem without (car) and
	with path constraints (car2)

2010-04-02  Miroslav Fikar  <miroslav.fikar@stuba.sk> 

	* added problem9 - optimal diafiltration

	* examples tested with matlab 2010a and its new solver sqp. In
	majority of cases, better results have been obtained, or fewer NLP
	iterations.

	* dynoptim/profiles.m: typos in comments

2009-02-24  Miroslav Fikar  <miroslav.fikar@stuba.sk> Version 4.1.3

	* problem3 did not print graph with constraint. main program was
	old. now ok.

	* problem7 was not working due to old syntax of process and
	objfun. now ok.

	* examples tested with matlab 2008b, all work, but with slight
	optimum changes (as with any different versions of matlab,
	fmincon, etc). Only problem1b is still with Matlab 2007a, did not
	converge under 2008. Older versions of matlab might have problem
	with line in the main program:
	options = optimset(options,'Algorithm','active-set');
	It can be commented if necessary. 

	* Users's guide - corrected several typos, all results calculated
	with matlab 2008b (except problem1b).

2008-10-24  Miroslav Fikar  <miroslav.fikar@stuba.sk> Version 4.1.2

	* No code changes. Repackaged, all dynopt functions now reside in
	a single directory dynoptim and not in further subdirectories. All
	other directories should be outside this tree so that the files
	and functions therein cannot interfere with others. Thanks to
	B. Roffel (NL) for spotting it.

	* Begin of a new ChangeLog
